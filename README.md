Hello world guided repository based on tutorial

I'm fairly new to coding. I have some basic HTML5, CSS3, SQL, JavaScript, and Python experience.Trying to pick up new skills like GitHub and version control. Eventually I would like to learn enough to be able to contribute to projects that I believe in and want to help with development as well as make my own projects.
